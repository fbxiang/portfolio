# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I received Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC San Diego advised by professor Hao Su. During my Ph.D. career, I developed the embodied AI simulation platform SAPIEN, now used by hundreds of institutes around the world. Prior to joining UCSD, I earned computer science and math dual bachelor's degrees from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
