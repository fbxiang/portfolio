    We present a method for generating high-quality watertight manifold meshes
    from multi-view input images. Existing volumetric rendering methods are
    robust in optimization but tend to generate noisy meshes with poor topology.
    Differentiable rasterization-based methods can generate high-quality meshes
    but are sensitive to initialization. Our method combines the benefits of
    both worlds; we take the geometry initialization obtained from neural
    volumetric fields, and further optimize the geometry as well as a compact
    neural texture representation with differentiable rasterizers. Through
    extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can generate accurate
    mesh reconstructions with faithful appearance that are comparable to
    previous volume rendering methods while being an order of magnitude faster
    in rendering. We also show that our generated mesh and neural texture
    reconstruction is compatible with existing graphics pipelines and enables
    downstream 3D applications such as simulation.

    We build a general-purpose Sim2Real protocol for manipulation policy
    learning with marker-based visuotactile sensors. To improve the simulation
    fidelity, we employ an FEM-based physics simulator that can simulate the
    sensor deformation accurately and stably for arbitrary geometries. We
    further propose a novel tactile feature extraction network that directly
    processes the set of pixel coordinates of tactile sensor markers and a
    self-supervised pre-training strategy to improve the efficiency and
    generalizability of RL policies.

    We proposes a novel part-guided 3D RL framework, which can learn to
    manipulate articulated objects without demonstrations. We combine the
    strengths of 2D segmentation and 3D RL to improve the efficiency of RL
    policy training. Frame-consistent Uncertainty-aware Sampling (FUS) strategy
    is designed to get a condensed and hierarchical 3D representation, improving
    the stability of the policy in reality. Futhermore, a single versatile RL
    policy can be trained on various tasks simultaneously in simulation and
    shows great generalizability to novel instances in both simulation and
    reality.

    Contrary to the vast literature in studying agent-object interaction, very few
    past works have studied the task of object-object interaction, which also plays
    important role in downstream robotic manipulation and planning tasks. In this

    learning framework for diverse object-object interaction tasks.
