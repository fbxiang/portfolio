    We constructed a PhysX-based simulation environment using PartNet-Mobility
    dataset to support household robotics tasks. I am the project leader and
    worked on the following: 1. Constructed web interface for annotation of
    articulated object dataset. 2. Worked on a high-level simulator backed by
    PhysX. 3. Implemented OpenGL rasterization and OptiX ray-tracing for scene
    rendering. 4. Benchmarked motion prediction task with ResNet50/PointNet++ on
    RGB-D/point cloud inputs.
