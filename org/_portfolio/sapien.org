* SAPIEN Engine
  I lead the development of SAPIEN Engine, which is a high-level interface for
  Nvidia PhysX simulator. My contributions include the following:
  - Full API design.
  - Robot integration.
  - PartNet-Mobility Dataset integration.

* SAPIEN Asset: PartNet-Mobility Dataset
  PartNet-Mobility dataset is a large-scale articulated object dataset that
  provides the content for SAPIEN environment. It contains more than 2K object
  models with more than 14k movable parts. This dataset is annotated by our
  group, based on the PartNet dataset. My contributions include:
  - Implemented and maintained the entire annotation interface, including NodeJS
    backend, MySQL database, and Angular 2 frontend.
  - Designed the entire annotation procedure and goals.

* SAPIEN Renderer
  I created SAPIEN Renderer from scratch using OpenGL and OptiX. My
  contributions include:
  - Developed OpenGL rasterization based renderer for visualizing the scene.
  - Developed GPU ray-tracer with Nvidia OptiX for physically accurate rendering.
