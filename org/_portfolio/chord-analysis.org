* Estimate chords

I had long been interested in music and decided to explore the harmonics of
music. I did this project on my own to get myself familiar with music analysis
and signal processing. Here are what I learned and achieved:

- Built a fully functional music player with Matlab
- Understood how music is stored and played
- Learned basic structures of music generation
- Learned discrete Fourier transform and short time Fourier transform
- Defined chord models and assigned probability to chords according to frequencies
- Here is a video demo of the program analyzing a music piece I wrote.
