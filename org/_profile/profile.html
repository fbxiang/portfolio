      I am the simulation tech lead at <a href="https://hillbot.ai">Hillbot</a>.
      I received Ph.D. in Computer Science at
      <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a> advised by
      professor
      <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/" target="_blank">Hao Su</a>.
      During my Ph.D. career, I developed the embodied AI simulation platform
      SAPIEN, now used by hundreds of institutes around the world. Prior to
      joining UCSD, I earned computer science and math dual bachelor's degrees
      from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am experienced in physical
      simulation, rendering, vision, and software development. I have basic
      knowledge on graphical design, 3D modeling, and music composition. My
      publications are available
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/profile/publications.html">here</a>.
