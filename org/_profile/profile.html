      I am a PhD student in computer science at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a>,
      advised by prof. <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/" target="_blank">Hao Su</a>.

      I am interested in rendering, physical simulation, reinforcement learning,
      and software performance. I currently focus on research in robotics and I
      have led software infrastructure design for robotics and machine learning
      teams. I also have basic knowledge on graphical design, 3D modeling, and
      music composition. For my publications, please click <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/profile/publications.html">here</a>.
